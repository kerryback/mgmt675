Create a skill (in `.claude/skills/`) that encodes a consistent methodology for one of the following:

**(a) DCF valuation skill** --- specify:

  - How to estimate each assumption (e.g., "use trailing 5-year revenue CAGR for sales growth," "use sector median EV/EBITDA for exit multiple")
  - Required output tables (pro forma income statement, FCF, sensitivity table)
  - Sensitivity ranges to test
  - Output format and labeling

**(b) Portfolio optimization skill** --- specify:

  - Data source and estimation window (e.g., "trailing 60 months of monthly returns")
  - Constraint set (e.g., no short sales, max 25\% per position)
  - Required outputs (weights table, frontier plot, key statistics)
  - Benchmark for comparison

Test the skill by running it on **two different inputs** (two different companies for DCF, or two different asset sets for portfolio optimization) in **separate conversations**. Verify that the methodology is consistent across both runs.

\noindent\textbf{Deliverables.}

- SKILL.md file (`4B-SKILL.md`)
- Output from first test (`4B-Test1.pdf`)
- Output from second test (`4B-Test2.pdf`)
- Brief note confirming methodology consistency or explaining where it differed (`4B-Consistency.pdf`, half page)
