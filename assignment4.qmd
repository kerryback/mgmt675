**Exercise 13: Beta Estimation in Excel.**
Download [exercise10-betas.xlsx](https://kerryback.com/mgmt675/files/exercise10-betas.xlsx) and open it in Excel with the Claude Add-in. Ask Claude to compute excess returns for WMT and run a regression to estimate its beta. Then ask Claude to create a scatter plot of excess returns with the regression line displayed. Submit the workbook (`Exercise13.xlsx`) with the regression results and chart. Submit a screenshot of the Excel workbook showing the scatter plot and regression output (`Exercise13-Screenshot.png`).

**Exercise 14: Debugging a Broken Spreadsheet.**
Obtain or create an Excel workbook that contains several intentional errors: a \#REF! error, a circular reference, a \#DIV/0! error, and at least one hardcoded value that should be a formula. Open it with the Claude Add-in and ask Claude to identify and fix all errors. Submit the original workbook (`Exercise14-Original.xlsx`), the corrected workbook (`Exercise14-Corrected.xlsx`), and Claude's explanation of each fix (`Exercise14-Explanation.pdf`). Submit screenshots of the workbook before (`Exercise14-Screenshot1.png`) and after (`Exercise14-Screenshot2.png`) Claude's fixes.

**Exercise 15: Investment Memo Skill.**
Create a Claude skill called `investment-memo` in your project's `.claude/skills/` folder. The SKILL.md file should define the output format (executive summary, business overview, financial analysis, risk factors, recommendation), specify workflows, and include code examples. Test the skill by asking Claude to write an investment memo for a public company. Submit the SKILL.md file (`Exercise15-SKILL.md`), the generated memo (`Exercise15-Memo.pdf`), and a screenshot of Claude invoking the skill (`Exercise15-Screenshot.png`).

**Exercise 16: M&A Due Diligence.**
Download [manda-due-diligence.zip](files/manda-due-diligence.zip) and extract the files into your project folder. You will have a customer list with contract details (Excel), detailed contract terms for top customers (PDF), acquirer screening criteria (Word), and industry benchmarks (CSV). In Claude Desktop's Code tab, ask Claude to: (a) extract contract terms and change-of-control provisions from the PDF, (b) apply the acquirer's screening criteria to each customer, (c) calculate quality-adjusted revenue and retention probabilities, (d) assess customer concentration risk, and (e) produce a due diligence summary suitable for an investment committee. Submit the due diligence output (`Exercise16-DueDiligence.xlsx`) and a screenshot of the Code session showing the steps Claude took (`Exercise16-Screenshot.png`).
