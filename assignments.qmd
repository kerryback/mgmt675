# Assigment 1

(a) You plan to put $8,000 in your retirement account next year.  You expect this amount to grow by 3% per year for 30 years.  You then hope to withdraw $100,000 per year for 30 years.  Ask Julius to calculate the account balance each year if you earn 8% on your investments.  Ask Julius to show the balance by year in a table and in a figure.  Check Julius' work and ask for corrections if needed.

(b) Now tell Julius to simulate the account balance by drawing each return from a normal distribution with a mean of 8% and a standard deviation of 15%.  What is the mean ending balance and what is the median ending balance?

Due by midnight, Sunday, March 17.  Submit both a Word doc and a Jupyter notebook of your conversation to Canvas.
