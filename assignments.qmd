# Assigment 1

You plan to put $8,000 in your retirement account next year.  You expect this amount to grow by 3% per year for 30 years.  You then hope to withdraw $100,000 per year for 30 years.  

(a) Ask Julius to create an array containing the 60 deposits and withdrawals, treating the withdrawals as negative.

(b) Tell Julius you hope to earn 8% on your investments and will make the deposits and withdrawals in (a) at the end of each year.  Ask Julius to calculate the account balance each year and to plot it and save the figure.  Check Julius' work and ask for corrections if needed.

(c) Now tell Julius to simulate the account balance by drawing each return from a normal distribution with a mean of 8% and a standard deviation of 15%.  What is the mean ending balance and what is the median ending balance?

(d) Ask Julius to create a histogram of the simulated ending account balances.

(e) Create a report describing the exercise (don't just copy and paste the above text) and including the figures and information learned.  You can ask Julius to write the report, but you are responsible for checking it.  Save the report to PDF.

Due by midnight, Sunday, March 17.  Submit a docx or pdf of the report to canvas.

# Assigment 2

Estimate the CVX cost of equity capital using the following data sources (Julius can get all of them by using the pandas datareader): adjusted closing prices from Yahoo, MKT-RF and RF from the Fama-French factors file from Ken French's data library, and the 1-month T-bill rate from FRED.  Get the 1-month T-bill rate on March 1, 2024.  Calculate the cost of equity capital as the T-bill rate + beta times market risk premium.  Use the last 60 months for which all variables are present to compute the beta (remember to subtract RF from the CVX return before running the regression).  In general, follow the steps in slide deck 3.  Write a brief report of your results.  Include a scatter plot with excess CVX returns (return minus risk-free rate) on the y axis and MKT-RF on the x axis.  Include the regression line in the scatter plot.
