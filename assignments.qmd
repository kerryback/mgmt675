# Assigment 1

You plan to put $8,000 in your retirement account next year.  You expect this amount to grow by 3% per year for 30 years.  You then hope to withdraw $100,000 per year for 30 years.  

(a) Ask Julius to create an array containing the 60 deposits and withdrawals, treating the withdrawals as negative.

(b) Tell Julius you hope to earn 8% on your investments and will make the deposits and withdrawals in (a) at the end of each year.  Ask Julius to calculate the account balance each year and to show the balances in a table and in a figure.  Check Julius' work and ask for corrections if needed.

(c) Now tell Julius to simulate the account balance by drawing each return from a normal distribution with a mean of 8% and a standard deviation of 15%.  What is the mean ending balance and what is the median ending balance?

(d) Ask Julius to create a histogram of the simulated ending account balances.
