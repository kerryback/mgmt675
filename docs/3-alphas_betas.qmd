# Alphas and Betas

## Objectives for this Week

1. Estimate the cost of equity capital for CVX
2. Evaluate the performance of Fidelity Magellan relative to a Fama-French benchmark

# Cost of equity capital

## Capital Asset Pricing Model

Expected stock return is $r_f + \beta \times \overline{r_m - r_f}$

1. Get today's $r_f$ from FRED
2. Get historical $\overline{r_m - r_f}$ from French's data library
3. Estimate beta by running regression
$$r - r_f = \alpha + \beta (r_m-r_f) + \varepsilon$$

Let's estimate the beta first.

## Data for regression

The regression is:
$$r - r_f = \alpha + \beta (r_m-r_f) + \varepsilon$$

a. CVX return $r$ from Yahoo adjusted closing prices
b. Risk-free rate $r_f$ from French's data library 
c. Market excess return $r_m-r_f$ from French's data library 


## Compute CVX returns

- Ask Julius to pip install yfinance==0.1.70 and import yfinance as yf
- Then (all instructions at once to avoid repeated downloads) ask Julius to: 
  - use yf.Ticker to get CVX closing prices (= adjusted closing prices) since 2010
  - downsample to end-of-month and compute returns as 100 times percent change
  - convert dates to pandas monthly period format

## Get Fama-French factors

 Ask Julius to use the pandas datareader 
 get the monthly Fama-French factors since 2010 from French's data library,

## Prepare data for the regression

- Ask Julius to do an inner merge on the dates of the CVX returns and Fama-French factors.
- Ask Julius to keep only the last 120 rows.
- Ask Julius to add the excess CVX return to the dataframe by subtracting RF from the CVX return.
- Ask Julius to show the head and tail of the dataframe.

## Run the regression

- Ask Julius to regress the excess CVX return on MKT-RF, including an intercept, and show a summary of the results.
- Ask Julius to assign the MKT-RF regression coefficient to a new variable called beta.

## Estimate the market risk premium

- Ask Julius to use pandas datareader to get the annual Fama-French factors from French's data library starting in 1926.
- Ask Julius to compute the mean of MKT-RF and assign it to a new variablecalled  market_premium.

## Get the current risk-free rate

- Ask Julius to use pandas datareader to get 1-month Treasury bill yields from FRED.
- Ask Julius to get the most recent 1-month Treasury bill yield and assign it to a new variable called rf.

## CVX cost of equity capital

Ask Julius to compute rf + beta * market_premium.

## Visualize the regression

- Ask Julius to produce a scatter plot with the excess CVX return on the y axis and MKT-RF on the x axis.
  - Tip: we might need to give Julius the name of the dataframe containing the excess CVX return and MKT-RF.
  - Look back at the code where Julius showed the head and tail of the dataframe to find the name.
- Ask Julius to include the regression line on the scatter plot.

## Visualization tips

- We can ask Julius to set the style of the plot.  I like the seaborn whitegrid style. 
- There are other choices: [seaborn plot styles](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html)
- If Julius is balky at including the regression line, ask it to create a seaborn regplot with ci=None.
- You can also specify the colors of the points and the line (the line could be a different color than the points).

## Interactive plots

- Suppose we're giving a presentation in which we show the regression plot.
  - We anticipate there might be questions about some of the points - e.g., extreme values.
  - We could tag them with annotations, but it creates clutter.
  - It might be useful to be able to hover over points and have pop-ups with details.
- This requires html.

## Use plotly

- Ask Julius to use the dataframe containing the CVX excess return and MKT-RF and to convert the dates to strings.
- Ask Julius to use plotly to create a scatter plot with a regression line, the CVX excess return on the y-axis, and MKT-RF on the x-axis.
- Ask Julius to include the date in the hover data.
- Ask Julius to save the figure as html.

## See the results

- Download the html file.
- Open it from Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder (it probably won't work opening it from your web browser).
- Try out different [plotly templates](https://plotly.com/python/templates/) - e.g., plotly_dark.
- More visualization coming next week.

# Mutual Fund Performance

## Performance measures

- Rankings
- Performance relative to benchmark (large cap, ...)
- Performance after adjusting for risk exposures
  - relative to benchmark adjusting for benchmark beta
  - or including other risk exposures
  - alpha = average return after adjustments

## Fama-French factors: motivation

- Certain types of stocks have beaten others historically
- Efficient markets view: must be due to risk exposures that investors care about
- Not sure what risks are, but use difference in returns of different types of stocks as proxies

## Fama-French 5 factors

- MKT-RF = market return minus T-bill return
- SMB = [S]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}mall stock return [M]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}inus [B]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}ig stock return
- HML = [H]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}igh book-to-market (value) return [M]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}inus [L]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}ow book-to-market return
- CMA = [C]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}onservative (low asset growth) return [M]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}inus [A]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}ggressive return
- RMW = [R]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}obust (high profitability) return [M]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}inus [W]{style="color: Tomato; font-weight: bold"}eak return

## Data

- Start a new chat.
- Repeat the steps in the Yahoo/Fama-French merge, except
  - Get FMAGX (Fidelity Magellan) from Yahoo for the maximum history possible
  - Get the monthly 5-factor Fama-French factors from French's data library for the maximum history possible
  - Keep all months after doing an inner merge (not just last 120)


## Run regression

- The regression is
$$r-\text{RF} = \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{MKT-RF} + \beta_2 \times \text{SMB}$$
$$+ \beta_3 \times \text{HML} + \beta_4 \times \text{CMA} + \beta_5 \times \text{RMW} + \varepsilon$$

- Ask Julius to add the excess FMAGX return to the dataframe (FMAGX return minus RF).
- Ask Julius to regress the excess FMAGX return on the Fama-French factors and report the summary.

## Interpretation

- A risk-adjusted benchmark for FMAGX is
$$(1-\beta_1)\times \text{RF} + \beta_1 \times \text{MKT} + \beta_2 \times \text{SMB}$$
$$+ \beta_3 \times \text{HML} + \beta_4 \times \text{CMA} + \beta_5 \times \text{RMW} + \varepsilon$$
- Call this BMARK.  The regression can be restated as
$$ r - \text{BMARK} = \alpha + \varepsilon$$
- $\alpha + \varepsilon$ is over-performance when positive and under-performance when negative.

## History of Over or Under-Performance

- Ask Julius to add a variable called over_under to the dataset defined as (regression intercept + regression residuals) / 100.
- Ask Julius to compute the cumulative product of (1 + over_under) and to plot it.

## Attribution analysis

- Attribution analysis is breaking down the benchmark.
- How much return comes from market exposure?  size exposure? value exposure? ...
- We can calculate the average return to the value exposure as $\beta_3 \overline{\text{HML}}$, etc.
- We can visualize these by plotting the cumulative product of 
$1 + \beta_3 \times \text{HML}/100$, etc.  
- Ask Julius.
