## Objectives 

- Frontier portfolios of risky assets (minimize risk subject to achieving a target expected return)
- Tangency portfolio (maximize Sharpe ratio)
- Estimate means, standard deviations, and correlations from historical returns
- Download adjusted closing prices from Yahoo Finance and compute returns


## Goal Seek in Python

- There are several choices in python for optimizing functions.
- The qp function from cvxopt is a very good choice for portfolio optimization.
  - cvxopt = convex optimization
  - qp = quadratic programming 

## Examples

- From Applied:
  - U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Japan 
  - U.S., Developed, Emerging
- ETFs from Yahoo Finance

## U.S., U.K., France, Germany, and Japan

- Download international.xlsx and international_corrs.xlsx from the [course website](https://mgmt675.kerryback.com).
- Upload the files to Julius.  Ask Julius to read them.
- Ask Julius to convert the means, standard deviations, and correlation matrix into numpy arrays.
- Ask Julius to compute the covariance matrix as a numpy array.

## 

- Ask Julius to use cvxopt to minimize variance subject to achieving a target expected return.
  - If allowing short sales, tell Julius there are no inequality constraints.
  - If excluding short sales, tell Julius to not allow short sales.
- Ask Julius to repeat for a range of target expected returns and to plot the expected returns and standard deviations.
