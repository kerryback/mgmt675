We will discuss and use current AI tools but also discuss broader concepts of AI and how they relate to finance. The course will be “hands-on.” We will be working in class on laptops each day.\nWe will use Anthropic’s Claude throughout the course. Anthropic has made a number of important innovations that the rest of the industry has followed, including a protocol for connecting AI to tools (Model Context Protocol), coding agents that can execute terminal commands (Claude Code), and code execution in a virtual machine (Claude Cowork). Claude has also generally led all other models in coding tasks for the past two years. We will also briefly look at ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language models.\nThe following lists the course topics in the order that we will study them. This is not a “by day” schedule. In discussing each AI tool, we will see how it can be used in financial analysis. The finance topics that we will cover are ones you have already seen in the core Finance course and the Applied Finance course that are prerequisites. The two finance topics on which we will spend the most time are mean-variance analysis and discounted cash flow valuation of companies.\n\nAI that writes and executes code\nAI coding for mean-variance analysis\nExecuting AI-written code in Jupyter notebooks\nConnecting tools to AI\nConnecting a virtual machine to AI\nConnecting your computer to AI\nUsing AI inside Excel\nAutomated as-needed loading of specialized prompts\nUsing AI inside an integrated development environment (IDE)\nUsing AI for discounted cash flow valuation of companies\nRetrieval augmented generation\nFine-tuning and small language models\nBuilding an AI agent\nTrading on news with AI\n\n\n\n\nGrades will be based on six group assignments (15% each) and peer assessments (10%). Groups can consist of no more than five students. Each assignment consists of multiple exercises and will take a nontrivial amount of time to complete. Do not wait until the last minute to get started.\nThe assignments are posted on Canvas. An assignment is due each Tuesday at 11:59 pm beginning March 24 and ending April 28 (during exam week).\n\n\n\nEach student will be reimbursed for a Claude Pro account ($20 per month). The Pro account provides access to Cowork, Claude Code, and the Claude plug-in for Excel, all through the Claude Sonnet model.\n\n\n\nThe Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course.\n\n\n\nAny student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance.
