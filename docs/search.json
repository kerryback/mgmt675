Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics\n\n\n\nRoom 318 McNair Hall TTh 12:30 – 2:00 3/12/2024 – 4/18/2024\n\n\n\nEach of us will, in the future if not already, use large language models (LLMs) as assistants. The models and interfaces will evolve, but it is worthwhile to learn what is available now and adapt as things evolve. Undoubtedly, everyone has already used ChatGPT and other LLMs for some purposes. What we will explore in this course is using ChatGPT with python to perform data analysis, specifically financial data analysis. We will use Julius.AI, which is an interface to ChatGPT with python (I’ll call it ChatGPT + Python).\nAt the end of the course, I anticipate that everyone may still prefer to use Excel for most things. However, there are some things for which ChatGPT + Python is better suited, and there are other things for which ChatGPT + Python may be faster. In any case, it is worthwhile to learn what can be done with this new tool, so we will be better prepared for the future. It is quite possible that everyone will end up using Python in Excel and Microsoft Copilot, rather than Julius.AI, but Python in Excel is not generally available yet, and, in any case, Microsoft Copilot + Python in Excel will also be a version of ChatGPT + Python. It is also quite possible that Google or someone else may surpass (or may already have surpassed) OpenAI, so maybe we should say LLM + Python, but we will use ChatGPT in this course.\nThe format of the course is that we will successively consider different types of analyses. We will perform each analysis live in class using Julius.AI. Then, your assignments will be to have similar conversations and to produce a figure or table or report, depending on the particular assignment.\nWe will spend roughly the first quarter of the course on topics that were covered in Applied Finance. This course will differ from Applied Finance in that we will ask ChatGPT + Python to do the work for us, instead of using Excel and @Risk. In the remaining 3/4 of the course, we will cover new topics, including machine learning and forecasting.\n\n\n\n\nIntro and simulation\nData handling\nCost of capital and performance evaluation\nVisualization\nPortfolio optimization\nAutocorrelation and autoregression\nMachine learning\n\n\n\n\nGrades will be based on weekly individual homework assignments (60%) and a seated exam during exam week (40%).\n\n\n\nJulius.AI provides a 50% academic discount. Sign up for a free account, then send an email using your Rice email account to team@julius.ai and ask for the academic discount. They will respond with a promo code to use. The Basic account allows 250 messages per month and will probably be ok. If the message limit becomes binding, you can always switch at that time to the Essential account, which allows unlimited messages. By using Julius, we can upload data files for ChatGPT to read and get ChatGPT to download and work with data from the web. You don’t need a separate account for ChatGPT through OpenAI. The Julius account will give you access to ChatGPT. Everything is run in the cloud from a web browser, so there is no software to download.\nIn addition to a Julius account, you should have a Google account for Google Colab and Google Drive. You won’t need any other software for the course. In particular, it is not necessary to have python installed on your computer.\n\n\n\nThe Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course. Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other.\n\n\n\nAny student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance. Students with disabilities should also contact Disability Support Services in the Allen Center."

    "text": "Kerry Back (kerryback@gmail.com) J. Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics\n\n\n\nRoom 318 McNair Hall TTh 12:30 – 2:00 3/12/2024 – 4/18/2024\n\n\n\nThis course will teach how to use large language models (LLMs) to perform financial analysis. As of December, 2023, the best performing LLM is ChatGPT4. It requires a Plus subscription to ChatGPT. We will also use certain plugins. Google has just released its Gemini LLM, which may be superior to ChatGPT4, but how it will be accessed is not yet clear.\nChatGPT and other LLMs have the potential to revolutionize financial analysis. There are three categories of activities where we may find ChatGPT or another LLM to be useful:\n\nSomething I could easily do myself but ChatGPT may be faster.\nSomething I could do myself but I will have to look up how to do it and hope I get it right. ChatGPT will almost certainly be faster.\nSomething I do not know how to do and would not likely be able to figure out even with Googling. ChatGPT may be indispensable.\n\nChatGPT is most important for the third category above and least important for the first. But, there is always a possibility that ChatGPT may make an error, and the possibility of ChatGPT making an error we do not catch is also greatest for the third category and least for the first. In other words, when we rely on ChatGPT more, the chances of an error increase. The goal is to be able to successfully use ChatGPT for all three categories with only minimal chance of letting an error get through.\nIt is not advisable to use ChatGPT or any LLM to perform mathematical calculations directly. Instead, we want the LLM to operate an application that is sure to do math correctly. There is currently no direct path from ChatGPT or any other LLM to Excel, though Microsoft is working on it. The best application to use with ChatGPT at this time is python. It is possible that the eventual path from ChatGPT to Excel will also go through python – Microsoft is currently beta testing Python in Excel. In any case, given current technology, we should use python for AI-assisted financial analysis. The answer today to the question “What financial analysis can be done with ChatGPT?” is “anything that can be done with python.”\nSo, what can be done with python? Literally anything and everything. We can grab online data or read our own data, do any sort of financial analysis, and prepare Word or html reports. We can also output figures as jpegs or pngs and output data tables as Excel files (though only with data – not with embedded formulas). We can even write entire interactive websites with python.\nHowever, there is a substantial learning curve to doing financial analysis with python. This is where ChatGPT comes in. We want ChatGPT to write the python code. We have to learn how to prompt ChatGPT, and we have to learn how to recognize errors. Learning to recognize errors is not as difficult as one might think, because it is much easier to read python than to write python, just as reading foreign languages is easier than writing them.\nThe format of the course is that we will successively consider different types of financial analyses. For each analysis, we will first look at python code that I have written to get a general understanding of what we can ask ChatGPT to do. We will then ask ChatGPT to write code to perform the same analysis. We will do this live in class, and then your assignments will be to have similar conversations with ChatGPT and to produce a figure or table or report, depending on the particular assignment.\n\n\n\n\nCalculating and visualizing stock returns\nFinancial ratios\nSimulation\nCost of capital\nMean-variance optimization\nLinear regression\nOverfitting and LASSO\nLASSO for logistic regression\nMachine learning for default prediction\nMachine learning for return prediction\nMachine learning for valuation\nInteractive and animated plots\n\n\n\n\nGrades will be based on weekly individual homework assignments (60%) and a seated exam during exam week (40%).\n\n\n\nThe Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course. Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other.\n\n\n\nAny student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance.
