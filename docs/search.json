Keep a log of each prompt you sent and what changed in the output. Submit the final Excel file and your prompt log with a brief reflection on the plan-execute-evaluate cycle.\n\n\nExercise 1C: System Prompt Design\nWrite a system prompt (300–500 words) for a custom chatbot that serves as a “client portfolio advisor.” The prompt should define the chatbot’s persona, specify its areas of expertise, set guardrails (e.g., never give specific buy/sell recommendations), and describe the response format. Test your system prompt by pasting it into a new Claude conversation as the first message, then ask three client-style questions. Submit the system prompt and the three Q&A exchanges."

Place the file in the folder open in VS Code.\n\nAsk Claude Code to compute annualized mean returns and standard deviations for each ETF and to produce a correlation matrix.\nAsk it to find the tangency portfolio using a risk-free rate of 4.5% and to report the portfolio weights, expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio.\nAsk it to plot the efficient frontier of the five risky assets and the capital allocation line from the risk-free rate through the tangency portfolio.\nAsk it to generate a Word document containing the statistics, portfolio weights, chart, and a brief interpretation of the results.\n\n Download meanvariance.xlsx"

Assume the portfolio is rebalanced annually to the tangency weights.\nAsk it to plot a fan chart showing the median path and the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentile paths.\nNow suppose you withdraw $6,000 per year (at the end of each year), growing at 2% per year for inflation. Ask Claude Code to simulate 10,000 paths and compute the probability that the portfolio is exhausted before 20 years.\nAsk Claude Code to find (by trial and error or optimization) the maximum initial annual withdrawal (growing at 2% per year) such that the probability of exhaustion within 20 years is at most 5%.\nAsk it to generate a Word document containing the fan chart, the probability of exhaustion, the maximum safe withdrawal amount, and a discussion of the results."

Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.\nAsk Claude Code to project free cash flows for the next five years (2025–2029) using reasonable growth assumptions based on the historical trends. Ask it to explain and justify the assumptions.\nAsk it to estimate a terminal value at the end of 2029 using a perpetuity growth model. Use a long-run growth rate of 3% and a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) of 10%.\nAsk it to discount all projected free cash flows and the terminal value back to the present at the 10% discount rate to obtain the enterprise value.\nUsing the most recent balance sheet, ask it to subtract net debt (total debt minus cash) from the enterprise value to obtain the equity value, and divide by shares outstanding to get the per-share value.\nAsk it to generate a Word document with the historical free cash flows, projected free cash flows, valuation summary, and a sensitivity table showing how the per-share value changes with different discount rates (8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%) and terminal growth rates (2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%).\n\n Download statements.xlsx"
