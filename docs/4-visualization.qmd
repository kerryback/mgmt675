## Types of Plots

- Distributions 
  - Histograms, density plots, box plots, pie charts 
- Bivariate
  - Line plots, scatter plots (with regression lines and with transparency), hexbin plots
- 3D
  - 3D plots, contour plots

## Extras 

- Control linestyle, linewidth, point style, point size, titles, axis labels, axis ticks, font sizes
- Annotations
- Subplots
- Interactive plots saved as html


- Ask Julius to get the history of 3-month, 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year Treasury yields from FRED.



## Visualization Examples

- Ask Julius to create a density plot of marketcap in the metrics dataset.
- Ask Julius to save as a jpeg and provide a link.

##

- Ask Julius to create a bar chart of total marketcap by sector using the merged dataset. 
- Ask Julius to make the font size larger. 
- Ask Julius to create a pie chart of the number of firms by sector using the merged dataset.

## 

- Ask Julius to use seaborn to create a boxplot of marketcap by sector.  Ask Julius to save as a png.
- Ask Julius to use plotly to create a boxplot of marketcap by sector in the merged dataset and to include the ticker in the hover data.  Ask Julius to save as html.

## 

- Ask Julius to calculate the daily percent changes in the crude oil price and to create a filled density plot using seaborn.
- Ask Julius to create a filled contour plot of the function $z=(4x + y)^2$ for $x$ and $y$ between $-2$ and $2$.
- Ask Julius to create a 3D plot of the same function on the same range.

## 

- Ask Julius to use plotly to create a figure containing line plots of the 3-month, 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year Treasury yields.  Ask Julius to save as html.
- Ask Julius to recreate the figure using the plotly_white template.
- Ask Julius to use plotly to create an animation showing a plot of the 3-month, 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year Treasury yields as a function of maturity.  Tell Julius to use the date as the animation frame.
