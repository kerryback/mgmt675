## Types of Plots

- Distributions
  - Histograms, density plots, box plots, pie charts 
- Bivariate
  - Bar plots, line plots, scatter plots (with regression lines and with transparency), hexbin plots
- 3D
  - 3D plots, contour plots

## Extras 

- Control linestyle, linewidth, point style, point size, titles, axis labels, axis ticks, font sizes
- Annotations
- Subplots
- Interactive plots and animations saved as html

## Distribution of market caps

- Upload the metrics and tickers datasets and ask Julius to merge them on ticker.
- Ask Julius to create a histogram, a density plot, a filled density plot, and a boxplot of marketcap.
- Ask Julius to use seaborn to create boxplots of marketcap by sector.
- Ask Julius to save the plots as jpegs and provide links.

## Pie charts and bar charts

- Ask Julius to create a pie chart of the number of firms by sector.
- Ask Julius to create a bar chart of total marketcap by sector. 

## Hover data

- Ask Julius to use plotly to create a boxplot of marketcap by sector in the merged dataset and to include the ticker in the hover data.  
- Ask Julius to save as html.

## Filled density plot

- Ask Julius to download crude oil prices from FRED, compute percent changes, and create a filled density plot of the percent changes.

## Scatter and Hexbin Plots

- Ask Julius to download the daily Fama-French factors from Ken French's data library.
- Ask Julius to use seaborn to create a regplot with Mkt-RF on the x axis and SMB on the y axis.
- Ask Julius to set the transparency parameter alpha to 0.1.
- Ask Julius to create a hexbin plot of SMB and Mkt-RF.

## Animations

- Ask Julius to get the histories of the 3-month, 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year Treasury yields from FRED.
- Ask Julius to use plotly to create an animation showing all of the yields as functions of maturity using the date as the animation frame.


## 3D

- Ask Julius to create a filled contour plot of the function $z=(4x + y)^2$ for $x$ and $y$ between $-2$ and $2$.
- Ask Julius to create a 3D plot of the same function on the same range.
