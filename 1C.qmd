Download [portfolio-consolidation.zip](files/portfolio-consolidation.zip) and extract the files. You will have holdings data from three brokerages in different formats (two Excel workbooks and one CSV).

Upload all three files to Claude.ai and ask it to:

(a) Merge all equity holdings into a single consolidated view with standardized columns
(b) Resolve inconsistencies between ticker symbols and full company names
(c) Sum shares for positions that appear in multiple accounts
(d) Produce a summary showing total portfolio value, top five holdings by market value, and asset allocation between equities and bonds
