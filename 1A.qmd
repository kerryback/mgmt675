Pick a specific finance role (e.g., equity research analyst, credit underwriter, portfolio manager, compliance officer). Using Claude.ai, have a conversation in which you identify five concrete tasks that AI could automate or augment in that role.

For each task:

- Describe what the task involves today (without AI)
- Classify it as **"maker" work** (producing output: models, reports, presentations) or **"checker" work** (reviewing, validating, catching errors)
- Explain how AI would change the task

Write a brief argument for which of the five tasks would deliver the most value if automated first.
