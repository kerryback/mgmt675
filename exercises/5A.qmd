Upload at least three financial documents for the same company into Google NotebookLM. Good combinations include:

- A 10-K filing
- An earnings call transcript
- An analyst report or press release

Ask at least **5 questions** about the company's financial performance, strategy, and risk factors. For each answer:

- Note how NotebookLM **cites specific sources** (which document, which section)
- Evaluate whether the answer is **grounded** in the documents or potentially **hallucinated**
- Rate the answer quality (accurate / partially accurate / inaccurate)

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Deliverables.}
