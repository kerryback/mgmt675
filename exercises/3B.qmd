In Google Colab, use Gemini to write code that:

1. Downloads daily price data for three stocks of your choice from Yahoo Finance (at least one year of data)
2. Computes daily returns
3. Produces the following outputs:
    (a) A **boxplot** of daily returns for the three stocks
    (b) A **summary statistics table**: mean, standard deviation, min, max, skewness, kurtosis
    (c) A **correlation matrix heatmap**

Save the notebook to Google Drive.
