Create a SKILL.md file for a sample database (the Chinook music retailer database or a dataset of your choice). The skill should include:

- **Schema description**: table names, columns, data types, and relationships
- **Business context**: what the data represents, key metrics, important definitions
- **Example queries** with expected output format
- **Guardrails**: common pitfalls, edge cases, things the skill should warn about

Test your skill by asking 5 **decision-relevant** questions --- not just data lookups, but questions a manager would ask. For example:

- "Which artist generates the most revenue, and is that revenue concentrated in one album?"
- "What's the trend in invoice totals by quarter --- is the business growing?"
- "Which sales rep has the highest average invoice value?"

Then have a classmate ask 3 questions they come up with (that you haven't tested). Document any failures and fix the SKILL.md.

\noindent\textbf{Deliverables.}

- SKILL.md file (`4A-SKILL.md`)
- Output from your 5 test queries (`4A-MyQueries.pdf`)
- Output from your classmate's 3 queries (`4A-PeerQueries.pdf`)
- Notes on any failures and fixes made (`4A-Fixes.pdf`, if applicable)
