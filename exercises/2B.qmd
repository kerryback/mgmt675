Build a two-stage discounted cash flow model for a hypothetical or real company. Start by providing Claude with a small set of assumptions:

- Sales growth rate, COGS as \% of sales, SG\&A, depreciation, tax rate
- NWC as \% of sales, PP\&E as \% of sales
- WACC, terminal growth rate

The model should include:

1. **Pro forma income statement** (5-year forecast): Sales $\rightarrow$ COGS $\rightarrow$ Gross Profit $\rightarrow$ SG\&A $\rightarrow$ Depreciation $\rightarrow$ EBIT $\rightarrow$ Taxes $\rightarrow$ NOPAT
2. **Pro forma balance sheet**: NWC and PP\&E as \% of sales, capital expenditure derived from target PP\&E
3. **Free cash flow**: NOPAT + Depreciation $-$ CapEx $-$ $\Delta$NWC
4. **Terminal value**: growing perpetuity method ($\text{TV} = \text{FCF}_{T+1} / (\text{WACC} - g)$)
5. **Enterprise value** and **per-share equity value**
6. **Two-way sensitivity table**: WACC (rows) vs.\ terminal growth rate (columns)

Produce the output as an Excel workbook with clearly labeled sheets.
