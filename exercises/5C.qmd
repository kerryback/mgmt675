Build a custom financial chatbot as a Streamlit app using the OpenRouter API with a free model (e.g., `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free`).

The chatbot should:

1. **Connect to a financial dataset** (a CSV file or small database)
2. **Include a system prompt** with schema knowledge and domain expertise --- tell the model what columns exist, what the data represents, and how to answer questions
3. **Let users ask questions in English** and display results

You can ask Claude Code to build the entire app for you. Focus on writing a good system prompt --- this is where the skill concepts from Module 4 apply.

Test with at least 5 financial questions and evaluate the quality of the answers.

\noindent\textbf{Deliverables.}

- Code (`6B-Code.zip`)
- Screenshot of the running app showing at least 3 exchanges (`6B-Screenshot.png`)
- Evaluation of answer quality (`6B-Evaluation.pdf`, half page)
