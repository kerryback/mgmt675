Download [manda-due-diligence.zip](../files/manda-due-diligence.zip) and extract the files into a project folder. You will have:

- A customer list with contract details (Excel)
- Detailed contract terms for top customers (PDF)
- Acquirer screening criteria (Word)
- Industry benchmarks (CSV)

In Claude Code (or the Code tab in Claude Desktop), ask Claude to evaluate the acquisition target **end-to-end**:

1. Extract contract terms and change-of-control provisions from the PDF
2. Apply the acquirer's screening criteria to each customer
3. Calculate quality-adjusted revenue and retention probabilities
4. Assess customer concentration risk
5. Benchmark against industry standards
6. Produce a due diligence summary suitable for an investment committee

Watch how Claude plans its approach, reads each file, and combines the results.
