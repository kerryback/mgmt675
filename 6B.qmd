Download an earnings call transcript for a company that had a **significant post-earnings stock move** (at least $\pm$3\% on the day after the call). Good sources include Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool Transcripts, or company investor relations pages.

Upload the transcript to Claude and ask it to:

1. **Rate management's overall tone** on a scale from $-5$ (very negative) to $+5$ (very positive)
2. **Identify 3--5 forward-looking statements** that differ from consensus expectations
3. **Flag hedging language** or qualifications (e.g., "cautiously optimistic," "subject to macroeconomic conditions")
4. **Summarize the Q\&A section** --- were analysts skeptical or supportive?

Compare Claude's assessment to the stock's actual post-earnings move. Did the tone analysis predict the market reaction? Where did it succeed or fail?
