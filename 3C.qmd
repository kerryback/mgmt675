Using the Claude for Excel add-in, build a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage amortization table. Inputs should include the loan amount, annual interest rate, and term in years.

The table should compute for each month:

- Monthly payment (using PMT or equivalent formula)
- Interest portion
- Principal portion
- Remaining balance

All values should use **live Excel formulas**, not hardcoded numbers. Tell Claude to use formulas rather than pasting values.

Create a chart showing the breakdown of principal vs.\ interest over the life of the loan.
