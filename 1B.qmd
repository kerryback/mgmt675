Using Claude.ai Artifacts, create an interactive app that lets a user input:

- Coupon rate
- Yield to maturity
- Face value
- Years to maturity

Assume semi-annual coupons. The app should compute the bond price and display an interactive chart showing how the price changes as the yield varies from 0% to 15%.

Publish the artifact so it has a shareable link.
