#### Course Description

Each of us will, in the future if not already, use large language models (LLMs) as assistants.  The models and interfaces will evolve, but we should learn to use what is available now and adapt as they evolve.  Undoubtedly, everyone has already used ChatGPT for some purposes.  What we will explore in this course is using ChatGPT with python to perform data analysis, specifically financial data analysis.  We will use [Julius.AI](https://julius.ai/), which is an interface to ChatGPT with python (I'll call it ChatGPT + Python). 

At the end of the course, I anticipate that everyone will still prefer to use Excel for most things.  However, there are some things for which ChatGPT + Python is better suited, and there are other things for which ChatGPT + Python may be faster.  In any case, it is worthwhile to learn what can be done with this new tool, so we will be better prepared for the future.  It is quite possible that everyone will end up using Python in Excel and Microsoft Copilot, rather than Julius.AI, but Python in Excel is not generally available yet, and, in any case, Microsoft Copilot + Python in Excel will also be a version of ChatGPT + Python.

The format of the course is that we will successively consider different types of analyses.  We will ask ChatGPT live in class to perform the analysis.  Then, your assignments will be to have similar conversations with ChatGPT and to produce a figure or table or report, depending on the particular assignment.

6.  Data visualization


#### Grading

Grades will be based on weekly individual homework assignments (60%) and a seated exam during exam week (40%).

#### Software

Julius.AI provides a 50% academic discount.  Sign up for a free account, then apply for the academic discount and use the promo code when creating a paid account.  The Basic account allows 250 messages per month and will probably be ok.  If the message limit becomes binding, you can always switch at that time to the Essential account, which allows unlimited messages.  By using Julius, we can upload data files for ChatGPT to read and get ChatGPT to download and work with data from the web.  You don't need a separate account for ChatGPT through OpenAI.  The Julius account will give you access to ChatGPT.  In addition to a Julius account, you should have a Google account for Google Colab and Google Drive.  You won't need any other software for the course.  In particular, it is not necessary to have python installed on your computer.

#### Honor Code

The Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course.  Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other. 

#### Disability Accommodations

Any student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to
contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations
regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance. Students with disabilities
should also contact Disability Support Services in the Allen Center.
