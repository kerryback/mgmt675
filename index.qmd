#### Course Description

ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize financial analysis.  There are three categories of activities where we may find ChatGPT to be useful:

1.  Something I could easily do myself but ChatGPT may be faster.
2.  Something I could do myself but I will have to look up how to do it and hope I get it right.  ChatGPT will almost certainly be faster.
3.  Something I do not know how to do and would not likely be able to figure out even with Googling.  ChatGPT may be indispensable.

ChatGPT is most important for the third category above and least important for the first.  But, there is always a possibility that ChatGPT may make an error, and the possibility of ChatGPT making an error we do not catch is also greatest for the third category and least for the first.  In other words, when we rely on ChatGPT more, the chances of an error increase.  The goal is to be able to successfully use ChatGPT for all three categories with only minimal chance of letting an error get through.

It is not advisable to use ChatGPT or any LLM directly to do math.  Instead, we want the LLM to operate an application that is sure to do math correctly.  There is currently no direct path from ChatGPT or any other LLM to Excel, though Microsoft is working on it.  The best application to use with ChatGPT at this time is python.  It is possible that the eventual path from ChatGPT to Excel will also go through python -- Microsoft is currently [beta testing Excel with Python](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-python-in-excel-55643c2e-ff56-4168-b1ce-9428c8308545#:~:text=To%20use%20Python%20in%20Excel,availability%20for%20Python%20in%20Excel).  In any case, given current technology, we should use python for AI-assisted financial analysis.  The answer today to the question "What financial analysis can be done with ChatGPT?" is "anything that can be done with python."

So, what can be done with python?  Literally anything and everything.  We can grab online data or read our own data, do any sort of financial analysis, and prepare Word or html reports.  We can also output figures as jpegs or pngs and output data tables as Excel files (though only with data -- not with embedded formulas).  We can even write entire [interactive websites](https://learn-investments.rice-business.org) with python.    

There is a substantial learning curve to doing financial analysis with python.  This is where ChatGPT comes in.  We want ChatGPT to write the python code.  We have to learn how to prompt ChatGPT, and we have to learn how to recognize errors.  Learning to recognize errors is not as difficult as one might think, because it is much easier to read python than to write python, just as reading foreign languages is easier than writing them.

The format of the course is that we will successively consider different types of financial analyses.  For each analysis, we will first look at python code that I have written to get a general understanding of what we can ask ChatGPT to do.  We will then ask ChatGPT to write code to perform the same analysis.  We will do this live in class, and then your assignments will be to have similar conversations with ChatGPT and to produce a figure or table or report, depending on the particular assignment.
