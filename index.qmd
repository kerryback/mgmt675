### Grading

Grades will be based on group projects, a group presentation, and peer assessments.  weekly individual homework assignments (60%) and a group project write-up (20%) and presentation (20%).  The presentations will be during exam week.

#### Group Project 1

Create a **Jupyter notebook** in Google Colab in which the user inputs the number of assets, their expected returns, their standard deviations, the correlation matrix, and the risk-free rate.  The notebook should compute the **tangency portfolio** and plot the mean-variance frontier and capital allocation line.  Due: 11:59 pm, March 31.

#### Group Project 2

Create a **web app** in which the user inputs  an income statement and balance sheet and forecasted future sales growth and certain financial ratios.  The app should generate a Word doc containing **pro forma income statements, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows**.  Due: 11:59 pm, April 24.

#### Group Project 3

Create a web app in which an **AI agent queries the user** regarding an income statement, balance sheet, and future sales growth and certain financial ratios.  The app should generate a Word doc and PowerPoint deck containing a **two-stage DCF analysis and an AI-generated discussion of the analysis**.  Due: 1:00 pm, April 28.
