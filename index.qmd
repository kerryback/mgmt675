### Grading

Grades will be based on three group projects (20% each), a group presentation (20%), and peer assessments (20%). The presentations will be on April 28 during exam week.

#### Group Project 1

Create a [**Jupyter notebook**]{style="color: tomato;"} in Google Colab in which the user inputs the number of assets, their expected returns, their standard deviations, the correlation matrix, and the risk-free rate.  The notebook should compute the [**tangency portfolio**]{style="color: tomato;"} and plot the mean-variance frontier and capital allocation line.  Due: 11:59 pm, March 31.

#### Group Project 2

Create a [**web app**]{style="color: tomato;"} in which the user inputs  a current income statement and balance sheet and forecasts of future sales growth and financial ratios.  The app should generate a Word doc containing [**pro forma income statements, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows**]{style="color: tomato;"}.  Due: 11:59 pm, April 24.

#### Group Project 3

Create a web app in which an [**AI agent queries the user**]{style="color: tomato;"} to build a current income statement, balance sheet, and to get forecasts of future sales growth and financial ratios.  The app should generate a Word doc and PowerPoint deck containing a [**two-stage DCF analysis and an AI-generated discussion of the analysis**]{style="color: tomato;"}.  Due: 1:00 pm, April 28.
