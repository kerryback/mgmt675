Collect 20 recent financial news headlines from sources such as Reuters, Bloomberg, or Yahoo Finance. For each headline, use Claude to classify:

- **Sentiment**: positive, negative, or neutral
- **Magnitude**: strong or weak
- **Relevance** to the stock price: high, medium, or low

Then look up the actual stock price movement on the day of each headline. Record the one-day return.

Calculate Claude's classification accuracy: what fraction of positive-sentiment headlines corresponded to positive returns (and vice versa)? Discuss where the model gets it right and where it fails --- pay attention to cases where nuance matters (e.g., "revenue beat expectations but guidance disappointed").
