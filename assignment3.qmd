**Exercise 9: Financial Data with MCP.**
Install the Alpha Vantage or Financial Modeling Prep MCP server in Claude Desktop. Use it to retrieve financial data for a company of your choice (e.g., income statement, balance sheet, or stock prices). Ask Claude to analyze the data and produce a summary table in Excel (`Exercise9.xlsx`). Submit screenshots showing (a) the MCP server in your config (`Exercise9-Screenshot1.png`), (b) the hammer icon with available tools (`Exercise9-Screenshot2.png`), and (c) the final Excel output (`Exercise9-Screenshot3.png`).

**Exercise 10: Browser Automation for Data Collection.**
Install the Browser-Use MCP server in Claude Desktop. Ask Claude to navigate to a financial website (e.g., Yahoo Finance or the SEC EDGAR site), extract a specific piece of data (e.g., the current market cap and P/E ratio for a company), and present it in a formatted response. Submit screenshots of the browser automation in action (`Exercise10-Screenshot1.png`) and the final result (`Exercise10-Screenshot2.png`).

**Exercise 11: Loan Portfolio Risk Analysis.**
Download [loan-risk-analysis.zip](files/loan-risk-analysis.zip) and extract the files into a folder. You will have a loan tape (Excel with 220 loans), state banking regulations (PDF), and an internal risk policy memo (Word). In Claude Desktop's Cowork tab, select the folder and ask Claude to: (a) extract the state-specific regulatory thresholds from the PDF, (b) extract the risk tier classification criteria from the Word doc, (c) assign each loan a risk tier and flag state-specific regulatory violations, and (d) produce a risk report showing tier distribution, flagged loans, and total estimated reserves. Submit the risk report (`Exercise11-Report.xlsx`) and a screenshot of the Cowork session (`Exercise11-Screenshot.png`).

**Exercise 12: Financial Statement Assembly.**
Download [financial-statements.zip](files/financial-statements.zip) and extract the files into a folder. You will have a current-year income statement (Excel), a balance sheet (PDF), a CFO memo with cash flow details (Word), and prior-year financials (CSV). In Cowork, ask Claude to extract data from all four files, map non-standard labels to GAAP line items, construct a statement of cash flows from the narrative memo, and build a comparative two-year financial summary with key metrics (gross margin, operating margin, net margin, current ratio, debt-to-equity, year-over-year growth rates). Submit the financial summary (`Exercise12-Summary.xlsx`) and a screenshot of the Cowork session (`Exercise12-Screenshot.png`).
