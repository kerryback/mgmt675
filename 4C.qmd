Take the DCF model you built in Exercise 2B. Start a **new** Claude conversation (do not continue the original) and upload the workbook. Ask Claude to critique the valuation:

1. **Identify at least 3 questionable assumptions** --- are the growth rates, margins, or discount rate reasonable?
2. **Check formula consistency** --- does FCF match the pro forma income statement and balance sheet?
3. **Evaluate the terminal value** --- is the implied terminal growth rate reasonable relative to GDP growth? What fraction of enterprise value comes from the terminal value?
4. **Suggest specific revisions** with justification

Revise the model based on the critique and compare the original and revised valuations.
