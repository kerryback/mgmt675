Ask Julius to compute the means, standard deviations, and covariance matrix as numpy arrays.  Ask Julius to find the frontier portfolios with weights summing to 1 and to plot their means and standard deviations.  Tell Julius that the risk-free rate is 5% and ask Julius to find the tangency portfolio and to include the capital allocation line in the plot.  Follow our March 26 conversations.  Write a report describing the exercise.  Include the weights of the tangency portfolio, the plot of the frontier and the capital allocation line, and a link to your Julius conversation.
